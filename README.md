# Tera Introspection

This crate provides a way to introspect a Tera template. The major code [src/parser](src/parser) is directly copied from [Tera](https://github.com/Keats/tera/tree/master/src/parser). The only new code is in [src/introspection](src/introspection). As this is something just for me to learn how the AST of the Tera template works, and the introspection is pretty hacky, I don't think it is good to contribute the code back to the Tera project.
